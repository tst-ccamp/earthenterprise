Custom folders
--------------

By default, GEE Portable stores cut globes in the Apache Document root
of the GEE Server at `/opt/google/gehttpd/htdocs/cutter/globes`.
However, you can move the portable globes folder to a custom location.
You might want to do this, for example, if this path is within a volume
with limited storage space and you have space available in a separate
volume.

Before you begin
----------------

-   Install and configure GEE Server on the machine that will support
    users who create portable globes.
-   Identify the path to your globes folder. This can be the same mount
    point for external storage of source data or the GEE Server
    Publish Root.
-   Gain access to an account with root-level privileges.

### To create a custom globes folder:

1.  Make sure that no globe cutting operations are in progress. Creating
    a custom folder makes modifications directly to the folder where
    portable globes are hosted and can interfere with any ongoing globe
    cutting operations.
2.  Stop the GEE Server service:\
    `sudo /etc/init.d/geserver stop `\
3.  Use either of the methods below to set up your custom folder:
    -   Create a new folder:\
        `mkdir /gevol/src/globes`
    -   Move the original folder to a storage volume:\
        `mv /opt/google/gehttpd/htdocs/cutter/globes /gevol/src/globes`

4.  Create a symbolic link from the custom folder to the original folder
    location:\
    `ln -sf /gevol/src/globes /opt/google/gehttpd/htdocs/cutter/globes`
5.  Change ownership of the custom folder to `geapacheuser:gegroup` and
    change permissions to 755 (rwxr-wr-w):\
    `chown -R geapacheuser:gegroup /gevol/src/globes`\
    `chmod -R 755 /gevol/src/globes`
6.  Start the GEE Server service.
7.  To test that globe cutting works, load the GEE Globe Cutting web
    page and either create a new portable globe or test with an
    existing globe. If you have an existing globe, click **List globes
    and maps directory** in the GEE Globe Cutting web page and make sure
    that your globe appears there.
